-- Changing a product's stock QU rescales every amount stored in it (recipe ingredients,
-- shopping list, meal plan, chores, stock). Without an old QU => new QU conversion the
-- factor falls back to 1.0, so e.g. 2 pieces silently became 2 kg. That was only refused
-- for products once added to stock; now it is refused whenever any of those amounts
-- reference the product.
